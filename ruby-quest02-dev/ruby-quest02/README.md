# Welcome to Ruby Quest02
***

## Task
The project still focuses on fundamentals of Ruby which include if_multiple_conditions, function declaration and usage with `return`, implementation of simple `while loop`. The challenge is understading the Ruby syntax to implement the tasks. 

## Description
I read the descriptions for each task and find out how the code could be written to specifications.

## Installation
Installation of Ruby is paramount.

## Usage
Each code runs to implement specified task. You need this command `ruby filename.rb` to test the codes.
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
