# Welcome to My Select Query
***

## Task
To create a class `MySelectQuery` with a constructor (`initialize` method) that takes a CSV content as a string and to implement the `where` method that takes two arguments column_name and criteria.

## Description
The method `where` added to the `MySelectQuery` class takes column_name and criteria as arguments. The `where` method, initializes an empty array called result, which will store the rows that match the given criteria.
It iterates through each row in the @data array. For each row, it checks if the value at the column_index matches the criteria. If it does, it adds the row (joined as a string) to the result array. It finally returns the result array, which contains the matching rows as strings.
## Installation
Instaall ruby compiler here `https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/` or copy the code to an online ruby compiler.

## Usage
The code provides a useful utility for parsing and querying CSV data in Ruby. It extracts specific information based on certain criteria within the data.
```
ruby my_select_query.rb to test the code
