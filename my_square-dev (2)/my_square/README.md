***

## Task
my_square is a project that create a beautiful square. It draws a rectangle using ASCII characters on the console. The `atoi` was difficult to understand initially.

## Description
 `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h` were two standard c libraries used. In the main function two arguments: ac (an integer that represents the number of arguments passed to the program) and av (an array of strings representing the actual arguments passed). If statement and if else is used to check The main function takes two arguments: ac, an integer representing the number of arguments passed to the program, and av, an array of strings representing the actual arguments passed. In the main function two arguments: ac (it is an integer that represents the number of arguments passed to the program) and av (an array of strings representing the actual arguments passed). If statement and if else statement were used in the for loops which prints the appropriate ASCII character for each position in the rectangle. The character "o" was used on the corners and "-" on the sides. For the other rows the character "|" are used on the sides and " " (space) in the middle. 

## Installation
Once the program compiles using `gcc -o my_square my_square.c`, it is good to go. No Installation required.

## Usage
You can use ./my_square 5 3 to text the code. 
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
